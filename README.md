# Erociator 

This program is a prototype of how a negotiation program would work. It takes in the initial price offered by the seller and the expected price by the buyer, and calculates a negotiated price based on that.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Simply run the `erociator.py` file and the program will start.

The program will ask for the name of the article, the price offered by the seller, and the expected price by the buyer. Once the user inputs these values, the program will calculate the negotiated price and display it to the user.

## Note

The negotiated price is not final and the user should negotiate further if possible.

Enter the name of the article: 
apple
Enter the price offered by the seller: 
10000
Enter the price at what you expect the seller to give you apple at: 
500
Negotiated amount is 3000.0

     Note:
        The formula in the code is a simple calculation but may not be applicable in all situations as it doesn't take into account specific details of the          negotiation.
        Negotiations are complex and require a thorough understanding of the market, item, and parties involved.
        It's important to use negotiation techniques and consider other factors to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
